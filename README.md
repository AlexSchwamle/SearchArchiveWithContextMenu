# Search Archive.org With The Context Menu
A Chromium extension that adds a context menu (right click) option to quickly search any hyperlink on Archive.org's Wayback Machine.

I got annoyed with seeing dead links so I made this to skip directly to Archive.org's search results.

## Setup
I haven't published this extension to the Chrome Web Store yet, so you just need to manually load the unpacked extension in developer mode.

1. **Go to Extensions page**
   - Type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter
   - OR click the menu (☰) → More Tools → Extensions
2. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Enable the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner
3. **Load Your Extension**
   - Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears
   - Navigate to and select the `src` folder in this repo

Done! Now any link you right click should have the "Search on Archive.org" option.

## Usage
- It only shows up for direct links to other pages
- When you encounter a dead link you can just right click it and select the new context menu option.
